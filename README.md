# Sars-CoV-2 Genomics
This folder is associated with Sars-Cov-2 genomics. It mainly contains (pipeline) scripts I have written for data analyses and other related information in the sample processing cycle.
# Pipeline
The pipeline script was created based on [gkarthik's](https://github.com/andersen-lab/paper_2018_primalseq-ivar/blob/master/cookbook/CookBook.ipynb) iVar works. It entails variant calling all the way to annotation.
